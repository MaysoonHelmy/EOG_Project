# EOG_Project
1. EOG Right and Left
Description:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients communicate with the world using eye movement, since their
voluntary muscles are paralyzed. Many efforts are exerted to support this way of communication by
tracking or detecting eye movement. Electro-oculogram (EOG) is an electro-physiological signal
generated by eye movement and can be measured using electrodes placed around the eyes. The
electrodes will be placed on the forehead. The two channels are arranged vertically and horizontally. Each
eye movement displays a positive or negative peak in the corresponding EOG signal. Human-machine
interface (HMI) can be developed based on eye movement recognition. These interfaces can help
paralyzed people to interact with smart phones or laptops and also can help them to move wheelchair or
play games without any help from others. In this project, we are interested to distinguish between left
and right movements using horizontal EOG signals.

Input:
EOG Signal
Output:
One label either “Right” or “Left”
Steps:
I. Preprocessing:
mean removal + Bandpass Filter (Butterworth 0.5 to 20) + normalization
Resampling to reduce computations
II. Feature Extraction: Wavelet (Daubechies family ( db 1-4 ) mother wavelets )
III. Classification: KNN
Dataset:
EOG dataset (sampling rate 176 HZ)
